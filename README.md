### Hello! I'm Vaddy, 21 yo Unity Developer from Kansas City ðŸ‘‹

My story begins in Syberia. There I started studying C# and Unity. I was only 12 yo. I used Game Maker for my first simple games. 
I'm very proud of my very first game that I developed as high school student with Unity Engine. This project is truly indie. All the content is made by myself and I'm happy to introduce it!
