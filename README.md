### Hello there! 

My name is Vadim, I'm a 22-year-old developer with a passion for creating immersive gaming experiences. My game development journey began in Siberia when I was 12 years old. I learned everything I could to give myself an advantage in game developement, using all the resources I could. I even learned English from a very young age so I could communicate in the "gamersphere" easier. Fast forward to now, I live in Kansas City with my fiancé. I have a strong knowledge of unity, and with that I have been able to dive into the world of game development! Throughout my journey, I've worked with a variety of studios that have allowed me to expand my skill set. I have spent my time designing captivating gameplay mechanics, crafting stunning visuals, and optimizing performance on every project I’ve had the privilege of working on. I'm always excited to collaborate with fellow developers and anyone who shares my passion for gaming! There’s nothing I enjoy more than bringing unique ideas to life, and creating memorable gaming experiences. If you're looking for a dedicated game developer with a passion for learning, innovating and optimizing let's connect!
