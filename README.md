### Hello there! 

My name is Vaddy. I'm a 21-year-old game developer with a passion for creating immersive gaming experiences. My journey in game development began in the remote landscapes of Siberia when I was just 12 years old, and I've been honing my skills ever since. Now, I'm based in Kansas City.

With a strong foundation in Unity, I've not only grown as a developer but also gained valuable insights into the gaming industry. Throughout my journey, I've worked on a variety of projects that have allowed me to expand my skill set. Whether it's designing captivating gameplay mechanics, crafting stunning visuals, or optimizing performance, I'm committed to delivering high-quality results.

I'm excited to collaborate with fellow creatives and clients who share my enthusiasm for gaming. Together, we can bring unique ideas to life and create memorable gaming experiences. If you're looking for a dedicated game developer with a passion for innovation, let's connect and turn your vision into reality.
