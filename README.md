### Hello! I'm Vaddy, 21 yo Game Developer from Kansas City ðŸ‘‹

My story begins in Syberia. I was only 12 years old when I started studying C# and Unity. As a result I had my very first game published on Google Play store when I was high school student. (All the content and game assets made by myself. [Click](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.birdscult.esca.android.shooter&hl=ru&gl=US) if you're interested)

Game development is my passion. Here Unity is my main tool. However I'm working not only with Unity. I'm very into studying and exploring new things. 
I'm also familiar to Android Studio and XCode. In friendships with Godot. In love with psychoanalysis.
