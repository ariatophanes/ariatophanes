### G'day! I'm Vadim, 20 yo Unity Developer from Saint-Petersburg  ðŸ‘‹

My story begins in childhood. I started studying C# and Unity when I was 12. Up to this moment I used Game Maker for my first games. 
I'm very proud of my very first game that I developed as high school student. This project is truly indie. All the content is made by myself. So meet this game called "ESCA 2019"!
